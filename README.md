Mega Mania
I built this game as an inspiration from the classical game that was on the Atari Systems for much of the system's lifespan. As a video game enthusiast myself, this game
was very fun to build. The project was built entirely in Java, and this project was used as a focus to learn object orientated programming. The sounds, controls, visuals, and even the nitpick aspects such as the healthbar or enemy movement was built similarly, along with me creating extra levels in the game. The project used many of Java's libraries such as JavaFX to build the user interface of the game and the keyboard events.
